# **Tic-Tac-Toe GenZ**
By Marco C. Pilaming
## **Game Overview**
The game **_Tic-Tac-Toe GenZ_** is inspired by the standard Tic-Tac-Toe game but with a twist. The twist of the game is to **_not attempt a draw, or else the score board will return to zero_**, meaning that **_both players lose the game_**. Players must think and use their strategies to gain points and to avoid having a draw. Also, if you think of **_restarting_** the game after clicking more than one cell, **_you cannot_**; you have to finish filling up the cells until the game is done.
## **Set-Up Instructions**
To launch the game in your browser, simply extract, clone the repository, or download the zip file from the code section, unzip the folder, choose the unzipped folder, double-click the "index.html" file, or drag the HTML file into your browser <sub> I used Google Chrome as default browser </sub>.
## **Technical Dependencies**
To run and modify it on Visual Studio Code, install the **_Live Server_** extension, after installing the extension, right-click on the "index.html" file and click on **_Open with Live Server_**. This will allow you to make changes to the game in real time.
## **Compatibility Information**
As long as the following criteria are satisfied, executing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code from this repository should generally work without any compatibility problems:

+ Relative Paths: Particularly if the code was moved from one directory structure to another, make sure that all file paths (such as images, scripts, and stylesheets) are correctly referenced.

+ Browser Plugins or Extensions: If you experience issues with the way HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are executed, make sure your plugins and extensions are turned off (if necessary).

If these requirements are met, the code should work properly in the majority of modern browsers. In many cases, you can fix specific problems by looking for error messages in the browser's developer console.
